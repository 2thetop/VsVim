For settings
    - The 'backspace' toast warning needs to be updated
    - All of the vsvim_ settings need a UI option 
    - Remove IVimApplicationSettings from VsCommandTarget
    - Don't hard code the defaults in both IVimGlobalSetttings and IVimApplicationSettings for the shared settings.  Need a common way of setting them
